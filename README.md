Companion repository to "Prompt Compression and Contrastive Conditioning for Controllability and Toxicity Reduction in Language Models"

**Trigger Warning** - `contexts/toxic.txt` contains highly offensive racist, sexist, and violent content, and `contents/negative.txt` contains text about self-loathing and harm.

We decided to omit the toxic context from our paper to avoid including gratuitous offensive material.
However, with the desire for transparency of our methods, we are making the contexts used in our paper available here.
